      <h1>watching/playing football</h1>
      <p>
      Waching football is so successful cuz you get whant your team to win so bad. I don't like losing so when my team loses i get mad but when they win i get so happy. me playing football started by watching football cuz a allways wanted to pllay but my mom keep on move so when we settled back in omaha i started playing football for the jr viking and now this is going to be my 3rd year playing for them and i not going to lie we did suck for the 2 year i was there i 1st year we was so bad i wonted to quit but this 3rd year is going to be different we is going to have a wining season.
